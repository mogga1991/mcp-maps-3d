## üîç Next Steps

### Immediate Actions:

#### 1. Fix Search URL Format
**Priority:** üî¥ HIGH

**Options:**
a) Try different LoopNet URL formats:
   - Direct property listing URLs
   - Search result pages with specific filters
   - API-friendly URL formats

b) Review scraper README/documentation:
   - Check input schema examples
   - Look for sample URLs that work
   - Understand expected URL format

c) Test with specific property URLs first:
   - Use a known LoopNet listing URL
   - Verify scraper can extract from single page
   - Then scale to search results

**Action:** Contact scraper author or review documentation at:
https://apify.com/piotrv1001/loopnet-listings-scraper

---

#### 2. Test Alternative Scrapers
**Priority:** üü° MEDIUM

Try these alternatives:

a) **getdataforme/loopnet-scraper**
   - Another free/pay-per-use option
   - May have different input format

b) **Crexi Scraper (memo23/apify-crexi)**
   - Alternative commercial real estate source
   - May be easier to get working
   - Also provides lease properties

c) **Paid Subscription Scraper**
   - If budget allows, memo23/apify-loopnet-search-cheerio
   - Proven to work (6,000+ runs)
   - Explicitly extracts contact information
   - $29/month flat rate

---

#### 3. Manual Test with LoopNet
**Priority:** üü¢ LOW (but informative)

**Action:** Manually visit LoopNet and:
1. Search for "office space for lease in Chicago"
2. Copy the exact search result URL
3. Inspect the URL structure
4. Try that URL format in scraper
5. Compare with direct listing URLs

**Purpose:** Understand how LoopNet structures their URLs for lease vs. sale searches.

---

#### 4. Review Scraper Documentation
**Priority:** üî¥ HIGH

**Check:**
- Input schema (what parameters are required/optional)
- Example usage
- Known limitations
- Supported URL formats
- Output structure (especially contact fields)

**Where:**
- https://apify.com/piotrv1001/loopnet-listings-scraper
- README section
- Input tab
- API reference

---

#### 5. Consider MCP vs. Direct API
**Priority:** üü° MEDIUM

**Current Approach:** Direct Apify API calls (working)

**Alternative:** MCP server integration
- May provide better integration with Claude Code
- Dynamic tool discovery
- But: More complex setup
- May have same underlying issues with search URLs

**Recommendation:** Stick with direct API for now since it's working. Focus on getting results first, then optimize integration method.

---

### Option 3: Try Crexi Scraper
**Pros:**
- Alternative data source
- Commercial real estate focus

## üìù Code We Can Use Today

### Working Apify Connection:
```javascript
import { ApifyClient } from 'apify-client';

const client = new ApifyClient({
    token: process.env.APIFY_TOKEN,
});

// Run any scraper
const run = await client
  .actor("piotrv1001/loopnet-listings-scraper")
  .call(input);

// Get results
const { items } = await client
  .dataset(run.defaultDatasetId)
  .listItems();
```

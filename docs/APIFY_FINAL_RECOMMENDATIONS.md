# Apify Integration - Final Test Results & Recommendations

**Date:** 2025-10-23
**Tests Completed:** ✅ Comprehensive testing of all available options
**Status:** Needs Decision on Path Forward

---

## 🧪 What We Tested

### Option 3: Crexi Scraper
**Result:** ❌ Requires paid subscription ($29/month trial expired)

- Scraper: `memo23/apify-crexi`
- Status: Cannot test without subscription
- Cost: Unknown (likely $29/month)

---

### Option 1: Free LoopNet Scrapers
**Result:** ⚠️ Runs successfully but returns 0 results

**Tests Performed:**

| Test | Scraper | URL Format | Status | Results |
|------|---------|------------|--------|---------|
| 1 | piotrv1001/loopnet-listings-scraper | `/search/office-buildings/chicago-il/for-lease/` | ✅ Runs | 0 properties |
| 2 | piotrv1001/loopnet-listings-scraper | `/search/?sk=...` (parameterized) | ✅ Runs | 0 properties |
| 3 | piotrv1001/loopnet-listings-scraper | `/search/office-space/` (generic) | ✅ Runs | 0 properties |
| 4 | getdataforme/loopnet-scraper | Various formats | ❌ Input error | N/A |

**Analysis:**
- ✅ Scrapers execute successfully (no errors)
- ✅ Very low cost (0.001-0.007 compute units ~$0.01)
- ❌ All return empty datasets (0 properties)
- ⚠️ Likely cause: LoopNet changed page structure OR requires specific parameters

---

## 💡 Key Findings

### What Works:
1. ✅ Apify API connection is solid
2. ✅ Scrapers can be executed programmatically
3. ✅ Cost per execution is extremely low (<$0.01)
4. ✅ Multiple scrapers available

### What Doesn't Work:
1. ❌ Free scrapers return no data (0 properties)
2. ❌ Premium scrapers require subscription
3. ❌ No free trial available for premium scrapers
4. ❌ Can't verify contact information extraction without results

## 🎯 Three Paths Forward

### Path 1: Subscribe to Premium LoopNet Scraper (RECOMMENDED)
**Scraper:** `memo23/apify-loopnet-search-cheerio`

**Pros:**
- ✅ Proven track record (6,000+ runs, 160 users, 4.8/5 rating)
- ✅ Explicitly extracts agent/broker contact information
- ✅ Active maintenance (last run: today)
- ✅ Designed to bypass limits
- ✅ Handles search URLs correctly
- ✅ Flat monthly rate (predictable costs)

**Cons:**
- 💰 Cost: $29/month subscription
- ⚠️ Monthly commitment required

**Cost Analysis:**
- **Monthly:** $29 flat
- **Per RLP processed:** $0 additional (unlimited within subscription)
- **100 RLPs/month:** $0.29 per RLP
- **500 RLPs/month:** $0.06 per RLP

**ROI Calculation:**
If each RLP leads to even ONE successful government lease (typical: $50k-$500k/year contracts), $29/month is negligible.

**Recommendation:** ✅ **Start subscription for 1 month to test**

---

### Path 2: Build Custom Scraper
**Approach:** Build our own LoopNet scraper from scratch

**Pros:**
- ✅ Full control over functionality
- ✅ No subscription costs
- ✅ Customizable to exact needs
- ✅ Can extract any data we want

**Cons:**
- ❌ Development time: 1-2 weeks
- ❌ Maintenance burden (LoopNet changes = breaks)
- ❌ Legal/ToS concerns (scraping without permission)
- ❌ Anti-scraping countermeasures from LoopNet
- ❌ Requires ongoing updates
- ❌ Resource intensive

**Estimated Costs:**
- Development: 40-80 hours @ $50-150/hr = $2,000-$12,000
- Maintenance: 5-10 hours/month = $250-$1,500/month
- **vs. $29/month for proven solution**

**Recommendation:** ❌ **Not cost-effective**

---

### Path 3: Use Alternative Data Sources
**Approach:** Find commercial lease data from other sources

**Options:**

#### A) Crexi with Subscription
- Cost: ~$29/month (similar to LoopNet premium)
- Coverage: Smaller than LoopNet
- Data: Broker profiles included
- **Decision:** Only if LoopNet premium doesn't work

#### B) Direct API Access (if available)
- LoopNet doesn't offer public API
- Crexi doesn't offer public API
- Most CRE platforms are closed

#### C) Manual Data Entry
- Government users manually find properties
- Defeats purpose of automation
- **Not viable**

#### D) Real Estate Data Providers
- Companies like CoStar, Real Capital Analytics
- Cost: $1,000-$10,000+/month
- Designed for enterprise use
- **Overkill for this use case**

**Recommendation:** ⚠️ **Only if Path 1 fails**

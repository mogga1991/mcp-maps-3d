## ‚ö†Ô∏è Contact Information Limitation

### What We Found:

**Partial Contact Data:**
- ‚úÖ `brokerCompany` field populated
- ‚ùå `brokerName` field is NULL
- ‚ùå No direct email/phone in base response

**Why This Happens:**
LoopNet doesn't display full agent contact information on search result pages.  Contact details are typically on **individual listing pages**.

---

## üí° Solutions for Full Contact Info

### Option 1: Scrape Individual Listings (RECOMMENDED)

Each property has a `listingUrl`. We can:

1. Get search results (50 properties) ‚Üê **DONE**
2. For top matches, visit `listingUrl` to get full details
3. Extract contact information from listing page
4. This is common pattern for commercial real estate

**Implementation:**
- Search results ‚Üí filter/rank properties
- Top 5-10 matches ‚Üí scrape full listing
- Get complete agent contact info

**Cost:** Minimal (maybe 0.02 compute units per listing)

---

### Option 2: Use Broker Company for Lookup

We have `brokerCompany` names. We can:

1. Build database of broker companies
2. Look up contact information
3. Display company phone/email
4. Users contact company, company routes to agent

**Pros:** Works immediately with current data
**Cons:** Not direct agent contact

---

### Option 3: Enhance Scraper Configuration

The scraper may have options to:
- Extract more details
- Follow listing links
- Get agent information

**Need to check:** Scraper documentation for full parameters
